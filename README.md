===============
Use a FusionBrain v4 on Linux, via d-sub.

Originally a mirror from https://svn.code.sf.net/p/linuxice/code/packages/fbd/

Per discussion on http://www.mp3car.com/fusion-brain/129622-fusion-brain-program-for-linux.html there are some steps undocumented in the repo. Will add as relevant files are also added.
